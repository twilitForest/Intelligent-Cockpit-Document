Jim,

This is the table Jamie is refering to.

Ok.  Thank you for the clarification.

Jim 
Per instructions from Arturo, we have to interpolate the values we get out of the model using a lookup 
table. 
 
        PDG_CGEA_1_2_V2_1_step( ); 
 
        u2_t_pct = (U2)PDG_CGEA_1_2_V2_1_Y.PG_front_percent_fill; 
        u2_s_powerdistgauge_frontfillpct = u2_POWERDIST_INTERPOLATE(u2_t_pct, 
&u2_sp_POWERDIST_PCT_INTPL_TBL[0]); 
 
        u2_t_pct = (U2)PDG_CGEA_1_2_V2_1_Y.PG_rear_percent_fill; 
        u2_s_powerdistgauge_rearfillpct  = u2_POWERDIST_INTERPOLATE(u2_t_pct, 
&u2_sp_POWERDIST_PCT_INTPL_TBL[0]);

Jamie, 
For the CGEA1_2 version:  Did your team do anything with the lookup table? Or did you perform: 
Front_Perceent_Fill ^ PG_LIN_FACTOR? 
It looks like the CGEA1_2 model does the power operation and the CGEA1_3 model does not. 
  
Arturo, I think this is why I’m getting whole numbers for the Front and Rear using the auto-code for the 
CGEA1_3.  What do you think?
